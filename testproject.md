## Documentation

### Create An Ubuntu Server

- Locate and click on **EC2** within the AWS management console.

> [!NOTE]
For security reasons, it's recommended to restrict SSH access to your IP address only. However, for the purpose of this documentation, access has been granted from anywhere.

**How to open a terminal in your downloads folder on windows:**

- Navigate to your downloads folder (or the folder where you saved your .pem file), right-click, and choose **Open in terminal**.

**How to open the Terminal in a specific folder where your EC2 instance key pair (.pem file) was downloaded on a Mac:**

1. **Using Finder:**
   - Open **Finder** and navigate to the folder where your `.pem` file is located (usually the Downloads folder).
   - Right-click (or Control-click) on the folder.
   - Select **Services** from the context menu, then choose **New Terminal at Folder**. (If you donâ€™t see this option, you might need to enable it in **System Preferences** under **Keyboard** > **Shortcuts** > **Services**.)

2. **Using Terminal with Drag and Drop:**
   - Open **Terminal** from Spotlight or Finder.
   - In Finder, navigate to the folder where your `.pem` file is located.
   - Drag the folder (or the `.pem` file) into the open Terminal window. This will automatically populate the Terminal with the path to that folder.
   - If you dragged the folder, you can type `cd ` (with a space) before dropping it to change into that directory. For example: `cd /Users/yourusername/Downloads/` (after dragging, it will show the complete path).

3. **Using the `cd` Command:**
   - Open **Terminal**.
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where your `.pem` file is located. For example, if your key pair is in the Downloads folder, type:

    ```
     cd ~/Downloads
    ```

   - Press `Enter` to execute the command.

After following any of these methods, your Terminal will be opened in the directory where your `.pem` file is located, and you can use it to execute commands related to your EC2 instance.

### Terminate The Created Ubuntu Server

You would be tasked with figuring ut how to do this by yourself. Take a look around your EC2 page in the AWS console and figure it out. Or do a little research online.

> [!NOTE]
Terminate, don't stop. **Terminate your instance.**
